In this repository you can find the script for a Data Engineering project consisting of the analysis a fictitious company whose name is Neptuno. 

Neptuno is a company dedicated to the Gourmet food and beverage niche who has lately suffered data quality issues. For this reason, several data cleansing and data wrangling
duties are performed to improve the quality of its data, and rules are implemented and enforced to achieve this purpose in the company's future endeavors.

In short, what is done in this project is to download databases from a Microsoft Azure cloud service Datalake with Apache Spark. Then, the databases are cleansed and wrangled 
with Pandas in an Azure Databricks environment to finally have the new validated data stored once again in another validated data folder of the same Azure Datalake. 






NOTE: The code was originally written in Spanish and translated into English for general readability purposes in terms of portfolio showcasing duties, which strictly and
functionally speaking means that some column names have also been translated into English when in practical terms are not supposed to.

NOTE 2: The details of the purpose and general function of the rules are extensively explained in their documentation (Section 3).
